# DevClub-Recruitment

I was on a vacation the full midsem break (I also talked about it to Atishya Sir). I returned on 11 March, by then I had only done little bit of research part. Other than that I had a compulsory NLN movie screening on 12 March and an APL quiz too is coming up this week. As a result I could not do much work.

I have completed the research part. The link is - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q65c80w7PVyDJRDqTvU2eVVTZr6wMP7l/view?usp=sharing Sharing this just in case if there was an error during form submission.

I tried to learn react in these 3 days, but realised that I won't be able to learn it and then make an webapp with it.
I was only able to make basic HTML page showing rough UI/UX that too in plain HTML/CSS (no react).
That page is hosted on github itself. Link is https://accercine.github.io/DevClub-Recruitment/

I have attached a PDF file (that I made at last moment) showing what I intended to make.
Accent color of the app will change according to money left. Become red if low money.
We can see spendings in the last day, week, month or year.
In spendings page table, clicking on any heading will sort the table according to it.
In loans page clicking on a name should bring up full history of lending and borrowing with that peson, showing amount and date.
Also the page will have onhover efect (like darkening on the table row background, button backgrounds, etc.)
The table design could be a little bit better.
The analytics page could show more information. This is just to show the styling.

I have also put an EXTRA folder showing my past work. Please take a good look at it.

Thanks,

Rohit Agarwal
