I participated in Google Code-in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Here's is some work from 2015, the year I was most active in and was very close to becoming a finalist too.

I did tasks for BRL-CAD. I would like you to take a look at their logo and the way they write their name (BRL in maroon and bold then hyphen the CAD in gray/black) to better understand my design choices in the works I am going to show you.

1. Website Design

The task was to propose a design for their homepage. Either submit a full HTML site or a photoshop file showing the design.
I made it in photoshop since I did not know CSS in class 9. I am showing this to show my design.

2. Promotional Video

The task was to make video showcasing different features of BRL-CAD. This was my submission. This was made in Keynote and iMovie. Some of the images/animations are made by me in photoshop/GIMP.

3. Book Layout

BRL-CAD has a user manual. The task was to make a book layout for the manual and show it through example pages which should have code, images, different levels of heading, cover , content page, etc.
Now I feel the cover is not so good but rest of it is good. I would like to point your attention towards the way i wrote page no.s.

4. Design Guideline cheat sheet

The task was to make a design guide sheet for new contributors to BRL-CAD. 

These were only some of the tasks I did then. These are the ones I personally like more. I can show more of them if asked.



I also participated in the Winter Assignments and won prizes for the website and the app.
